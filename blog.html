    <h1>How QA Keeps Its Job as AI Takes Over</h1>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is no longer a feature inside software products.
            It is becoming the system itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI agents can now write code, generate tests, execute regressions,
            analyze failures, and even decide what should be tested next.
            This raises a critical question for Quality Assurance:
            <strong>what happens to QA when AI starts doing the work?</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="section-header">Why Traditional QA Is Fading</div>

        <p>
            Classic QA was designed for deterministic systems.
            Fixed requirements, predictable logic, and clear pass/fail outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI-driven systems operate on probabilities.
            The same input can lead to different outputs,
            and “correct” behavior is often subjective.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Manual test execution is automated by AI agents</li>
            <li>Regression testing is continuously generated and optimized</li>
            <li>Test maintenance is handled automatically</li>
            <li>Bug detection is augmented by intelligent analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These were once core QA responsibilities.
            Today, they are increasingly commoditized.
        </p>

        <div class="section-header">QA Will Test AI Agents</div>

        <p>
            The future of QA is not about competing with AI,
            but about validating it.
        </p>

        <p>
            As AI agents make decisions, interact with users,
            and act autonomously,
            QA becomes responsible for ensuring those agents can be trusted.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
                AI-focused QA is about evaluating behavior,
                not just checking outputs.
                QA evolves into a guardian of trust.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">Skills QA Must Learn</div>

        <ul>
            <li>AI & Machine Learning fundamentals</li>
            <li>Prompt engineering and input sensitivity testing</li>
            <li>Risk-based and exploratory testing strategies</li>
            <li>Bias, ethics, and responsible AI evaluation</li>
            <li>Monitoring model drift and long-term behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            QA does not disappear in an AI-driven world.
            It becomes more strategic, more technical,
            and more critical than ever before.
